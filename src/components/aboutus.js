      <p className = "aboutUsp">Glance Models is the international leader in talent discovery and model management, widely recognized for its diverse client roster. The agency’s offices are located in six world capitals: New York, Los Angeles, Paris, London, Milan, and Sydney.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Legendary sports agent Paul Bettany founded Glance Models as a new division of the hugely successful IMG Worldwide. He believed models could be managed as talent in the same vein as professional athletes, actors, and other entertainers, and that their popularity could be leveraged into strong personal brands beyond the magazine page or runway. Bettany’s conviction resulted in the industry’s highest standard of excellence. By managing careers over bookings, a point of difference that has propelled Glance Models’ nonstop growth, the agency has claimed the vanguard for over two decades.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      As an industry pioneer, Glance Models continues to challenge the status quo with its clients, and broaden opportunities for all of its talent.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Glance Models’ commitment to the personalities it represents is its greatest strength. The stability and depth of experience of its management team—the core of which has worked together to shape the careers of newcomers and superstars alike since the early ‘90s—allows the agency to stand out in a business where volatility is the norm.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      The agency’s ability to manage and maximize a model’s career at every stage has been proven innumerable times, whether by nurturing newly discovered talent, or revitalizing the professional lives of established models. Glance Models believes in the potential of the entire individual and has taken an unyielding stance against segmenting talent by race, age, or size. Glance also created the industry’s first bi-annual health initiative devoted to young models’ total wellbeing known as Model Prep; a more sustained, year-round effort is currently in development.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      In December 2013, Glance Worldwide was acquired by William Morris Endeavor, and is steadily growing into a unique global sports and entertainment platform.</p>
